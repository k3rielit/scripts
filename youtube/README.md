## NORMALIZE LINKS
Just replaces ```youtube.com/redirect``` links with the real one. Mostly pointless though.
## HOW TO USE
1. Install the Tampermonkey extension. ([Link](https://www.tampermonkey.net))
2. [Install](https://github.com/k3rielit/scripts/raw/main/youtube/normalize-links.user.js)
## UPDATES
If it breaks, I'll try fixing it

(If youtube changes their use of class names, it will break. Which didn't happen to ```yt-formatted-string``` for a long time, but whatever...)
